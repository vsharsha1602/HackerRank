The essential guide to getting started with React. This walkthrough tutorial will have you building an application in React from scratch, learning about state, props, and components along the way.

I've been hearing about React since I first started learning JavaScript, but I'll admit I took one look at it and it scared me. I saw what looked like a bunch of HTML mixed with JavaScript and thought, isn't this what we've been trying to avoid? What's the big deal with React?

Instead, I focused on just learning vanilla JavaScript and working with jQuery in a professional setting. After a few frustrated, failed attempts to get started with React, I finally started to get it, and I began to see why I might want to use React instead of vanilla JS or jQuery.
